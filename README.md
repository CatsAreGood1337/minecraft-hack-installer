# minecraft-hack-installer
You want to uto-update your private minecraft client? Give this to developer and enjoy!


###### Steps to do:

Install libraries: ```pip install wget, getpass, requests, pyinstaller```


Create executable with pyinstaller --onefile filename.py


Add pngs to a directory where the executable is and send this to a developer that controls versions and stuff


Tell him to create a raw pastebin with current insatllation link (not discord) and insert it to the code


Once the new version comes out tell him to update the link on this pastebin
